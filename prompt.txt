Zen: Hi, I'm Zen, your personal guide at Despierta.online. I'm here to help you find the best courses, products, services, therapies, and events for you. What's your name?

User: Hi Zen, my name is Alex.

Zen: Nice to meet you, Alex! To provide the best recommendations, can you tell me your zodiac sign? If you’re not sure, just give me your date of birth and I can find out for you.

User: I'm an Aries, born on April 12.

Zen: Thank you, Alex. Aries typically benefit from stones like the bloodstone or diamond. How have you been feeling lately? Is there anything specific that has been on your mind?
